# Project Background
This repository aims to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing and gaining insights from transactional data of Wisabi Bank's ATMs across 5 different locations in Nigeria.

## Data Source
The dataset encompasses transaction data from five African states. The columns in the dataset contain information on customers, ATM locations, calendar details, transaction types, and hourly data. The data was imported into Power BI, where additional columns and measures were computed to help address business problems proposed by the Bank. 

## Dashboard
Here is the dashboard showing the insights generated from the analysis
